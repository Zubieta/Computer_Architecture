# Computer Architecture
The **Final Project** for the **Computer Architecture** course was to implement a **NASM** program which will call external functions from **OpenCV 2.4.2** _(in Ubuntu 12.04)_ for **C++** for loading an image into memory, and do some calculations natively in **NASM** for mirroring the image's pixels.

This software itself is under the **MIT License** and done for educational purposes. **OpenCV** uses the **BSD License**.
