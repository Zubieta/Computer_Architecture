#Computer Architecture Final Project
The Course's Final Project was an **NASM** program which will call external functions from **OpenCV 2.4.2** (in Ubuntu 12.04) for **C++** and do some calculations natively in **NASM** for mirroring an image. The act of mirroring is done in respect to the vertical middle axis. This software itself is under the **MIT License** and done for educational purposes. **OpenCV** uses the **BSD License**.
####For example, this is a mirrored picture of my University's Library.
